<p>The detailed policy of the course along with the mark distribution is listed here</p>

<h2 id="teaching-and-learning-methodology">Teaching and Learning Methodology</h2>

<p>This course is designed in such a manner to help learners get the essence of principles behind the basic foundations of modern operating systems and networks. To this end, the course will follow a problem based learning methodology. Learners will be taught concepts of operating systems and networks by making them work on light weight operating system (MIT Xv6) as well as by providing them with concrete problems that captures the essence of the concepts taught during the lectures. Morover, the tutorials will be done through flipped classroom mechanism where the focus of tutorials will be to explain concepts through examples. We believe that this will promote deeper engagement and understanding.</p>

<h2 id="zero-tolerance-on-plagiarism">Zero Tolerance on Plagiarism</h2>

<p>This course requires student to submit assignments, participate in in-class activities, give mid and final exams, work with groups on projects and so on. <strong>Any forms of cheating or plagiarism will result in a score of 0</strong> for projects, assignments or exams. Egregious cases will result in a <strong>grade of F</strong> for the course. <a href="https://intranet.iiit.ac.in/offices/static/files/Policy_on_Academic_Misconduct.pdf">Please check the institute policy on Academic Misconduct</a></p>

<h2 id="use-of-ai-tools">Use of AI tools</h2>

<p>Students are free to use different AI tools like ChatGPT, Co-pilot, Cursor, etc. for the course assignments/projects. However, please do mention what tools and how they have been used in the submission report. This would imply that the students need to <strong>document the prompt</strong> used and the <strong>screenshot of the output produced</strong> by the AI tool on the report. Please note that while documenting the prompt, its important to ensure that they are documented step by step such that they are reproducible during evaluation (while using the same AI tool). Remember the different demos given in the class on how sometimes these tools can mislead or provide wrong solutions. Its important to know the concept before using the tools. Tools are at the end-of-the day enablers. Today it will be ChatGPT tomorrow it will be something else but the concepts needs to be clear to leverage the different tools. Bottomline, feel free to use different tools but <strong>use them wisely!</strong></p>

<p><em>Please note that the instructors reserve the right to award 0 if the use of AI tools is not appropriately documented or acknowledged</em></p>

<h2 id="extra-days-and-soft-deadlines">Extra Days and Soft Deadlines</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Each student will have 7 extra days, which can be used both for mid submissions and final submissions of Mini Projects. They can use these late days at their discretion throughout the course. Extra days will allow the student to submit Mini Projects post the deadline without incurring any penalty. Making a late submission will not be considered as a late submission if the student has extra days left. The extra days will be exhausted first before the submission is considered late.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every mini project will have a soft deadline followed by a hard deadline after 7 days. If the student makes a submission after the soft deadline, he/she will be penalized for every additional day until the hard deadline (if they have exhausted their extra days quota). For example, lets assume that the soft deadline is Sep 1 2025. This implies that the hard deadline will be Sep 8, 2025. The student in this case will be allowed to submit until Sep 8 2025. Assuming that the student has, for instance, 5 extra days left, they can delay submissions until Sep 6 2025 after which the submission will be penalized for each additional day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No submissions will be entertained post the hard deadline. This implies that the corresponding submission will be evaluated with <strong>0 points</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="grading-policy">Grading policy</h2>

<ol>
  <li>The students can request a re-evaluation of the grade until a week after the particular grade has been posted. After that the student may not discuss prior grades with the instructor.</li>
  <li>There will be no make up quiz/activity/exam under any circumstances unless a prior permission is granted.</li>
  <li>In case if a student is not able to submit an assignment/project on time, he/she can make use of extra days and soft deadline facility as explained above. No submissions will be entertained post the hard deadline. No e-mails from students regarding assignments extensions will be entertained.</li>
  <li>Although course project grades are assigned for the entire team, each individual may be given a higher or lower grade (up to 50%) based on his/her contribution. Individual contribution for each project/assignment will be measured through multiple mechanisms.</li>
